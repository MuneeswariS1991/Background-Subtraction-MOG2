# Background-Subtraction-MOG2
Background Subtraction is one of the major Image Processing tasks. It is used in various Image Processing applications like Image Segmentation, Object Detection, etc. OpenCV provides us 3 types of Background Subtraction algorithms:-  BackgroundSubtractorMOG BackgroundSubtractorMOG2 BackgroundSubtractorGMG Normally, we can perform background Subtraction using matrix subtraction, i.e, just subtracting the static frame from the video. But this has a lot of drawbacks. It is a very less efficient algorithm for Background subtraction because it does not update itself. This problem is being handled by the Background Subtraction algorithms provided by OpenCV.
